# Discovery

To manually refresh the displayed information, click or tap the
![refresh](_media/icons/Refresh.svg ':class=mdicon :no-zoom') refresh symbol ❶
in the application bar. Please **do not use your browser's refresh button**, as
this will _reload the complete_ UI instead and you'll end up again with no
discovery information displayed.

## Cyclic Refresh

Clicking or tapping the down pointing arrow next to the ![sync
off](_media/icons/SyncOff.svg ':class=mdicon :no-zoom') or
![sync](_media/icons/Sync.svg ':class=mdicon :no-zoom') refresh cycle symbol ❷
reveals a menu with options to choose from several automatic refresh rates, or
to switch any automatic updates off again. As frequent discovery refreshes cause
some IED load, please opt for slow refresh rates or refresh only manually when
needed.

## Shark Count

After the first discovery you should notice a number badge ❶ appearing next to
our cute Edgeshark mascot in the application bar. This badge counts the number
of virtual IP stacks discovered in your container host.
